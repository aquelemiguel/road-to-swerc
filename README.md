# road-to-swerc
Repository to hold personal competitive programming exercise solutions from places like SPOJ and UVa.

## Dynamic Programming
* [**DBALLZ**](https://www.spoj.com/problems/DBALLZ/) ([Solution](https://github.com/aquelemiguel/road-to-swerc/blob/master/spoj/june-2018/DBALLZ.cpp))  
A simple unbounded knapsack problem, since it allows item repetition. The distraction times are weights and the time spans are the values. *Beware, as SPOJ toolkit yields incorrect results.*

* [**PARTY**](http://www.spoj.com/problems/PARTY/) ([Solution](https://github.com/aquelemiguel/road-to-swerc/tree/master/spoj/june-2018/PARTY.cpp))  
A simple 0/1 knapsack problem where the parties' fees are weights and their fun are the values.

## Binary Search
* [**AGGRCOW**](https://www.spoj.com/problems/AGGRCOW/) ([Solution](https://github.com/aquelemiguel/road-to-swerc/blob/master/spoj/june-2018/AGGRCOW.cpp))  
*Can cows be spread in such a fashion that the distance between each cow is at least x?*  
If we cannot ensure cows are separated by at least x stalls, we cannot ensure separation by y stalls (y>x).

## Ad-hoc
* [**CANDY**](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CANDY/) ([Solution](https://github.com/aquelemiguel/road-to-swerc/blob/master/spoj/june-2018/CANDY.cpp))  
For each bag which is below average, add a movement because a candy must be moved from a bigger bag.

* [**HANGOVER**](https://www.spoj.com/problems/HANGOVER/) ([Solution](https://github.com/aquelemiguel/road-to-swerc/blob/master/spoj/june-2018/HANGOVER.cpp))  
Keep adding cards from top to bottom until the overhang exceeds the input.

* [**TRICOUNT**](https://www.spoj.com/problems/TRICOUNT/) ([Solution](https://github.com/aquelemiguel/road-to-swerc/blob/master/spoj/june-2018/TRICOUNT.cpp))  
There's a cool [formula](http://www.billthelizard.com/2009/08/how-many-triangles.html) that perfectly counts the no. of triangles inside of triangles.
